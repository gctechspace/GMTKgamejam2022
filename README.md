## Getting started

Clone this repo and add the root folder to Unity Hub.

It will take a while to open the first time as it will collect the packages and build files the project needs that are not included in the repo.
Once open, the scene may be called "Untitled" and empty. Navigate to "SampleScene" where I have made a simple scene. Explore here, experiment, break it. 
Use the play arrow at the top the start the game and again to stop it.
